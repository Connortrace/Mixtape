      [Verse 1: Jack Harlow]
  Young boy, big dreams, ain't nobody got those no more
  All these motherfuckers wanna ride my wave
  That's cool if it floats your boat
  People be living vicariously through me
  Say you my friend, but I swear you a groupie
  I am myself, I am like no one else
  So there's really no use in comparin' to me
  Man, I swear it's amusing
  Honestly though, you must think that I'm stupid
  Spent all my life just observing these humans
  And watching their movements, I'm seeing right through it
  You see what I'm doing, I'm bringing the heat
  And I'm bringing the passion
  I think I'm the shit, I can tell that that bothers you
  Honestly, all that I needs a reaction
  Back to the hustle
  Rise to the top from the ash and the rubble
  When they send shots, I don't have to rebuttal
  I'm a hurricane homie, you a splash in the puddle
  So what is the motive?
  I just assume that you want me to notice
  I just assume that you secretly love me and honestly
  Probably don't want me to know it
  </p>

    [Bridge: Jack Harlow]
    Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
    Looking for that thing that gon' change my life
    Man that shit's so real, had to say that twice
    Hands on the wheel, I'm a take my time
    I'm just searching for something that's new to me
    Truthfully, usually, naturally I would be doin' me
    Lately it seems like I'm not what I used to be
    </p>

   <p> [Hook: Jack Harlow]
   I'm just ridin' round town, ridin' round town
   Yeah, I said I'm ridin' round town
   Looking for that brand new
   Looking for that brand new
   Yeah, I said I'm looking for that brand new
   Ridin' round town, ridin' round town
   Yeah, I said I'm ridin' round town
   Looking for that one thing
   Looking for that one thing
   Yeah, I said I'm looking for that one thing

  <p>[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
  I been searching for the truth, but I ain't find no answers
  Questioning the facts, since back when I was in pampers
  Looking for myself, trying to find me
  Trying not to give a fuck about society's standards
  Doing what I do, cause your boy got the flame
  That gon' take him to the top like a Chinese lantern
  Everybody really wanna have an opinion
  Something that they never really had to begin with
  So tuned in, but they don't do shit
  If you say one thing, then they act so offended
  Ya girl say she likes how I rap when I spit shit
  Face got the beauty and the ass got the thickness
  Spit something for her cause she look real good
  And I'm trying to impress till I'm back to the business
  If you in the crowd, hope you got your hands up
  Look up in the mirror, I just got more handsome
  When you in the whip, this an aux cord anthem
  Played this for my dad and my pop's like, "Damn, son!"
  If I want it, I'ma do it, to be honest with you homie
  I ain't fucking with your music
  You've been going through the motions
  I've been running through the movements
  I've got tunnel vision, honest, you don't want to get into it
  They love the way I spit it, something like its mucus
  Saying I'm the shit like I'm running through the sewage
  I would do it all day if I could, but I can't
  Cause I spend seven hours in a public institution
  I'm talking all day, fella
  This the type of shit that makes Kanye jealous
  Its like an intervention going on the game
  Cause I promise that it's nothing that y'all can't tell us
  </p>

  <h3 id="Johnny_Cash"> Johnny Cash - Hurt</h3>
  <p>[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything </p>

<p>[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt</p>

<p>[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here</p>

<p>[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt</p>

<p>[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way</p>
