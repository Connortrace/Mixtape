    <p>Lyrics<br> </br>
      [Verse 1: Jack Harlow]<br>
  Young boy, big dreams, ain't nobody got those no more<br>
  All these motherf wanna ride my wave<br>
  That's cool if it floats your boat<br>
  People be living vicariously through me<br>
  Say you my friend, but I swear you a groupie<br>
  I am myself, I am like no one else<br>
  So there's really no use in comparin' to me<br>
  Man, I swear it's amusing<br>
  Honestly though, you must think that I'm stupid<br>
  Spent all my life just observing these humans<br>
  And watching their movements, I'm seeing right through it<br>
  You see what I'm doing, I'm bringing the heat<br>
  And I'm bringing the passion<br>
  I think I'm the shit, I can tell that that bothers you<br>
  Honestly, all that I needs a reaction<br>
  Back to the hustle<br>
  Rise to the top from the ash and the rubble<br>
  When they send shots, I don't have to rebuttal<br>
  I'm a hurricane homie, you a splash in the puddle<br>
  So what is the motive?<br>
  I just assume that you want me to notice<br>
  I just assume that you secretly love me and honestly<br>
  Probably don't want me to know it<br>
  </p>

   <p>
    [Bridge: Jack Harlow]<br>
    Looking for that thing that gon' change my life<br>
    Looking for that thing that gon' change my life<br>
    Man that shit's so real, had to say that twice<br>
    Hands on the wheel, I'm a take my time<br>
    I'm just searching for something that's new to me<br>
    Truthfully, usually, naturally I would be doin' me<br>
    Lately it seems like I'm not what I used to be<br>
    </p>

   <p> [Hook: Jack Harlow]<br>
   I'm just ridin' round town, ridin' round town<br>
   Yeah, I said I'm ridin' round town<br>
   Looking for that brand new<br>
   Looking for that brand new<br>
   Yeah, I said I'm looking for that brand new<br>
   Ridin' round town, ridin' round town<br>
   Yeah, I said I'm ridin' round town<br>

  </p>


  <p>[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]<br>
  I been searching for the truth, but I ain't find no answers<br>
  Questioning the facts, since back when I was in pampers<br>
  Looking for myself, trying to find me<br>
  Trying not to give a fuck about society's standards<br>
  Doing what I do, cause your boy got the flame<br>
  That gon' take him to the top like a Chinese lantern<br>
  Everybody really wanna have an opinion<br>
  Something that they never really had to begin with<br>
  So tuned in, but they don't do shit<br>
  If you say one thing, then they act so offended<br>
  Ya girl say she likes how I rap when I spit shit<br>
  Face got the beauty and the ass got the thickness<br>
  Spit something for her cause she look real good<br>
  And I'm trying to impress till I'm back to the business<br>
  If you in the crowd, hope you got your hands up<br>
  Look up in the mirror, I just got more handsome<br>
  When you in the whip, this an aux cord anthem<br>
  Played this for my dad and my pop's like, "Damn, son!"<br>
  If I want it, I'ma do it, to be honest with you homie<br>
  I ain't fucking with your music<br>
  You've been going through the motions<br>
  I've been running through the movements<br>
  I've got tunnel vision, honest, you don't want to get into it<br>
  They love the way I spit it, something like its mucus<br>
  Saying I'm the shit like I'm running through the sewage<br>
  I would do it all day if I could, but I can't<br>
  Cause I spend seven hours in a public institution<br>
  I'm talking all day, fella<br>
  This the type of shit that makes Kanye jealous<br>
  Its like an intervention going on the game<br>
  Cause I promise that it's nothing that y'all can't tell us<br>
  </p>

  <p>[Verse 1]<br>
I hurt myself today<br>
To see if I still feel<br>
I focus on the pain<br>
The only thing that's real<br>
The needle tears a hole<br>
The old familiar sting<br>
Try to kill it all away<br>
But I remember everything<br> </p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
What have I become<br>
My sweetest friend?<br>
Everyone I know<br>
Goes away in the end<br>
And you could have it all<br>
My empire of dirt<br>
I will let you down<br>
I will make you hurt<br></p>

<p>[Verse 2]<br>
I wear this crown of thorns<br>
Upon my liar's chair<br>
Full of broken thoughts<br>
I cannot repair<br>
Beneath the stains of time<br>
The feelings disappear<br>
You are someone else<br>
I am still right here<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
What have I become<br>
My sweetest friend?<br>
Everyone I know<br>
Goes away in the end<br>
And you could have it all<br>
My empire of dirt<br>
I will let you down<br>
I will make you hurt<br></p>

<p>[Outro]<br>
If I could start again<br>
A million miles away<br>
I would keep myself<br>
I would find a way<br></p>

  [Intro]<br>
I used to be cool (Be cool)<br>
I used to be new (Be new)<br>
Just like you told me, that time in school<br>
We could cut class (We could cut class)<br>
We could hold hands (We could hold hands)<br>
We could go to prom, but I can’t really dance<br></p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br>
You used to let me copy<br>
'Cause I would never study<br>
You used to text me every day and tell me I was funny<br>
I was the shy kid, sitting in silence<br>
Fell on my face, pick me up, keep me smiling<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
I met you in the summer<br>
Everything I wanted<br>
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet<br>
You could throw me away, when the colours fade<br>
I'll be back in your arms on another day<br>
I met you in the summer<br>
Everything I wanted<br>
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet<br>
You could throw me away, when the colours fade<br>
I'll be back in your arms on another day<br></p>

<p>[Verse 2]<br>
Then you got new friends<br>
Left the old ones<br>
But the new ones (New ones, new ones)<br>
Not the best ones<br>
You said that you met one (Met one)<br>
At your college, he’s an alcoholic<br>
If we're really being honest (Being honest)<br>
They don’t really care about you like I do<br>
And every time I tell you that, you think I’m tryna fight you<br>
I’m not tryna fight you<br>
Take me back to high school<br>
You said you wanna die, I guess I’mma say goodbye too<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
I met you in the summer<br>
Everything I wanted<br>
After time passed, started feeling like a puppet<br>
You could throw me away, when the colours fade<br>
I'll be back in your arms on another day<br>
I met you in the summer<br>
Everything I wanted<br>

<p>
  [Intro]<br>
I gotta lot to say<br>
Don't listen to what I say<br>
'Cause every feeling that I fucking feel is never honest, babe, never honest, babe<br>
Like woah, oh<br>
I've been following the breeze so let me fucking go<br></p>

<p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Let me go, let me go, I've been trying to find the road<br>
If you get up in my whip with me we'll head to my abode<br>
So baby what you doing? I just wanna go home<br>
I can scoop you like whenever, take you back home in the morn<br>
Like<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br></p>

<p>[Verse]<br>
I said we could fucking make it out<br>
Grabbed me by the face and kiss me, then we started making out<br>
I was listening to DGD and it was raining out<br>
Voices in my head been asking "What are you complaining 'bout?"<br>
'Cause everything is golden, I've been in my zone and if you wanna roll we could smoke it later<br>
Live inside this moment, write it and compose it, italicize and bold it, to formulate a<br>
Time to recall, the door down the hall, another<br>
Sorta prequel to fit the sequel, I kinda<br>
Sorta feel small, not noticed at all, until I<br>
Wrote a song for it, I wrote a song for it<br>
Here's how it goes, a bunch of weed smoke, I panic<br>
Start to feel so sick down to my toes, I'm manic<br>
Time just feels slow, it comes and it goes, the static<br>
Is all I see though, as I decompose, how tragic<br>
How tragic<br>
Yeah, how tragic<br>
Yeah, how tragic<br>
Yeah<br></p>

<p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Let me go, let me go, I've been trying to find the road<br>
If you get up in my whip with me we'll head to my abode<br>
So baby what you doing? I just wanna go home<br>
I can scoop you like whenever, take you back home in the morn<br>
Like<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br>
We, we, we, we, we could fucking make it out<br></p>

<p>
  [Verse 1]<br>
Just so good at being in trouble<br>
Spending my days out in the ghetto<br>
Mama say that I need to be careful<br>
Going downtown on the Blue Line Metro<br>
Car overheated and I can't afford a rental (Shit)<br>
Broke down Chevrolet, sitting on Central<br>
Turning up my headphones looking out the window<br>
Lauryn Hill playing, it could be so simple<br>
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get on<br>
What the hell is taking so long?<br></p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
I wish I had a girl by my side<br>
Wish I had a brand new ride<br>
I wish I had a light<br>
I wish I had a private flight<br>
I wish upon the stars sometimes<br>
I wish I had it right<br>
I wish I had the finer things<br>
I wish I wasn't so Cobain<br>
I wish I had you (Shit)<br>
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central<br></p>

<p>[Verse 2]
Just so good at being in trouble<br>
Spending my days out in the ghetto<br>
Papa say that I need to be careful<br>
Heard a nigga just got popped at the Arco<br>
Pros on the hoe stroll, junkies on narcos<br>
Long Beach, Compton, Watts to South Central<br>
Damn, I just can't wait 'til I get home (Shit)<br>
That's when a cop had pulled me over</p>

<p>[Chorus]<br>
I wish I had a girl by my side<br>
Wish I had a brand new ride<br>
I wish I had a light<br>
I wish I had a private flight<br>
I wish upon the stars sometimes<br>
I wish I had it right<br>
I wish I had the finer things<br>
I wish I wasn't so Cobain<br>
I wish I had you (Shit)<br>
And I wish I wasn't stuck on Central<br></p>

<p>[Outro]<br>
I wish I was in control<br>
Really wish I wasn't stuck on Central<br>
I still got so far to go, yeah<br>
Won't be stuck here, not for long<br>
Just hold on, hold on<br>
Work late nights and early mornings<br>
I'm on it, I'm on it<br>
Trouble on Central with the homies<br>
Oh no, oh no<br>
Pretty soon we gon' take control<br>
Just wait on it, wait on it<br></p>

Nah, nah<br>

A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain)<br>
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin')<br>
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')<br>
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)<br>

This-a-way, that-a-way<br>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade<br>
And that's just how I feel<br></p>

<p>[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
Nah, nah<br>
A dollar might just f your main b<br>
That's just how I feel, nah<br>
A dollar might say f them homies that you came with<br>
That's just how I feel, nah, nah<br>
A dollar might just make that lane switch<br>
That's just how I feel, nah<br>
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich<br>
That's just how I feel<br></p>

<p>[Bridge: Anna Wise]<br>
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!<br>
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!<br>
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!<br>
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!<br>
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!<br>
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!<br>
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!<br>
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!<br></p>

<p>[Verse 3: Jay Rock]<br>
Imagine Rock up in them projects<br>
Where them homies pick your pockets<br>
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings<br>
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'<br>
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'<br>
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'<br>
My homeboy just dome'd a homie<br>
I just hope the Lord forgive him<br>
Pots with cocaine residue<br>
Every day I'm hustlin'<br>
What else is a thug to do<br>
When you eatin' cheese from the government?<br>
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em<br>
Get the f up out my way, bish<br>
Got that drum and I got them bands<br>
Just like a parade, bish<br>
Drop that work up in the bushes<br>
Hope them boys don't see my stash<br>
If they do, tell the truth<br>
This the last time you might see my ass<br>
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut<br>
Them serpents lurkin', Blood<br>
B sellin' p, homies sellin' drugs<br>
But it's all good<br>
Broken promises, steal your watch<br>
And tell you what time it is<br>
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is<br>
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees<br>
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]<br>
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah<br>
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'<br>
Everybody gon' respect the shooter<br>
But the one in front of the gun lives forever<br>
(The one in front of the gun, forever)<br>
And I been hustlin' all day<br>
This-a-way, that-a-way<br>
Through canals and alleyways, just to say<br>
Money trees is the perfect place for shade<br>
And that's just how I feel<br></p>

<h3 id="sean"> Sean Kingston - Beautiful Girls</h3>
<p>
  [Intro: J.R. Rotem]<br>
J.R., Sean Kingston</p>

<p>You're way too beautiful, girl<br>
That's why it'll never work<br>
You have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
When you say it's over<br>
Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
They only wanna do you dirt<br>
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
When they say it's over<br></p>

<p>[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]<br>
See, it started at the park<br>
Used to chill after dark<br>
Oh, when you took my heart<br>
That's when we fell apart<br>
'Cause we both thought<br>
That love lasted forever (Lasted forever)<br>
They say we're too young<br>
To get ourselves sprung<br>
Oh, we didn't care<br>
We made it very clear<br>
And they also said<br>
That we couldn't last together (Last together)<br></p>

<p>[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]<br>
See, it's very defined<br>
You're one of a kind<br>
But you mash up my mind<br>
You haffi get declined<br>
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Sean Kingston]<br>
You're way too beautiful, girl<br>
That's why it'll never work<br>
You have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
When you say it's over<br>
Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
They only wanna do you dirt<br>
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
When they say it's over<br></p>

<p>[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]<br>
It was back in '99<br>
Watchin' movies all the time<br>
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime<br>
And I never thought<br>
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)<br>
And then I came out<br>
Mami moved me down south<br>
Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world<br>
It came out to be<br>
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)<br></p>

<p>[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]<br>
See, it's very defined<br>
You're one of a kind<br>
But you mash up my mind<br>
You haffi get declined<br>
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Sean Kingston]<br>
You're way too beautiful, girl<br>
That's why it'll never work<br>
You have me suicidal, suicidal<br>
When you say it's over<br>
Damn all these beautiful girls<br>
They only wanna do you dirt<br>
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal<br>
When they say it's over<br></p>

<p>[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]<br>
Now we're fussin'<br>
And now we're fightin'<br>
Please tell me why<br>
I'm feelin' slighted<br>
And I don't know<br>
How to make it better (Make it better)<br>
You're datin' other guys<br>
You're tellin' me lies<br>
Oh, I can't believe<br>
What I'm seein' with my eyes<br>
I'm losin' my mind<br>
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)<br></p>

<p>[Outro: Sean Kingston]<br>
You're way too beautiful, girl<br>
That's why it'll never work<br>
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal<br></p>

<h3 id="baby"> Lil Baby & 42 Dugg - Grace</h3>
<p>
  [Verse 1: 42 Dugg]<br>
Got a lotta new flames, still need them blue<br>
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two<br>
New Dawn, no roof, I still see the sky<br>
Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys<br>
Turned his back, must've felt let down<br>
Heard I'm down seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?<br>
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now<br>
Luke, get up, doggy, I need you<br>
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'<br>
Free Nef still, homie, RIP Reese<br>
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature<br>
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this<br>
All that fuckin', I don't do no kissin'<br>
Bitches ain't shit, word to my homies<br>
All in my mentions (Damn)<br>
Bitch really wanna get hired<br>
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson<br>
I done hit more shit than Mike Tyson<br>
Get popped, homie, I ain't doin' no fightin'<br>
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right<br></p>

<p>[Verse 2: Lil Baby]<br>
Car too fast, can't stop at no light<br>
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off<br>
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off<br>
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off<br>
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out<br>
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss<br>
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars<br>
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?<br>
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em<br>
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy<br>
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise<br>
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard<br>
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it<br>
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it<br>
Everything that I got, it was made for me<br>
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully<br>
Everybody with me gotta eat<br>
Say your grace with me<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br>
Please don't reach for no chain<br>
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect<br>
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang<br>
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank<br>
They greet me at the door by my government name<br>
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change<br>
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah<br></p>

<p>[Verse 3: Lil Baby]<br>
Right back on it, designer my garments<br>
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down<br>
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down<br>
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down<br>
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'<br>
I done got rich, everybody my cousin<br>
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother<br>
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter<br>
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another<br>
My mother, she happy now<br>
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated<br>
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes<br>
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately<br>
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis<br>
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement<br>
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Lil Baby]<br>
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br>
Please don't reach for no chain<br>
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect<br>
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang<br>
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank<br>
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)<br>
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change<br>
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah<br></p>

<p>[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]<br>
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it<br>
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings<br>
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million<br>
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building<br>
Fucked a homies ho, so he say he wanna kill me<br>
I miss Tev, this shit was different<br>
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my homies<br>
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you<br>
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on<br>
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on<br>
Still'll flood a homie town with a truckload<br>
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust girls<br>
If the feds in the house, a homies told on me<br>
I pray to God my soul to keep<br>
G5 just beat his murder<br>
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt<br>
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous<br></p>

<p>[Chorus: Lil Baby]<br>
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust<br>
Please don't reach for no chain<br>
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect<br>
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang<br>
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank<br>
They greet me at the door by my government name<br>
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change<br>
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah<br></p>
